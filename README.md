In this Ethereum-based smart contracts, I have developed a basic decentralized exchange (DEX) that empowers users to engage in token trading without the need for a central authority. The contract offers several key functionalities:


## Key Features

### Token Management

- **Deposit & Withdraw**: Seamlessly manage your tokens by depositing and withdrawing them to and from the exchange. Your individual token balances are meticulously tracked, ensuring trust and reliability in every transaction.

### Order Creation & Cancellation

- **Create Orders**: Craft orders tailored to your trading needs. Specify the token you want to receive, the desired amount, the token you're willing to offer, and the corresponding amount. Rest assured, the contract checks that you have sufficient tokens to place your order.

- **Cancel Orders**: At any time, you can cancel your own open orders. Our contract keeps a watchful eye on order cancellations, preventing any canceled orders from being executed.

### Order Execution

- **Trade with Confidence**: When you're ready to trade, you can fill existing orders on the exchange. Our contract meticulously validates each order to ensure it's legitimate, not canceled, and not yet executed. Once a trade is executed, tokens flow seamlessly between the trading parties.

### Trading Fees

- **Fair & Sustainable**: To support the exchange's operation and sustainability, a nominal trading fee, specified as a percentage, is deducted from the amount received by the user executing the order. These collected fees are directed to a predefined fee account.

### Transparent Events

- **Track & Analyze**: Throughout every transaction and trade, the contract emits events. These events provide a transparent and auditable record of all activities on the exchange. External applications can readily use this information for monitoring and analysis.

Happy trading!
